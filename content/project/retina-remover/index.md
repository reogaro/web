# Retina Remover 9000

![](laser-symbol.svg)

The Retina Remover 9000 was a school project for which a friend and I designed and built a laser engraver from scratch. It uses a 2W china 450nm diode laser source with FluidNC Firmware and a CoreXY motion system to burn decorative patterns into wood, cardboard, plastic and more.
