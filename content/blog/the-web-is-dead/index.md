# FREE AND OPEN

*The original spirit of the web is dead.*

![](hugo.png)

In march of 1989, Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, envisioned a democratic space for freely sharing knowledge, information and research. The resulting protocols and standards evolved into the "World Wide Web" we know today.

During the early years of the web this spirit thrived: Users built their own websites, openly sharing passions, information, and more. And even throughout the 90s and 00s, this spirit persisted. From hand-rolled HTML pages to vibrant WordPress blogs, a user's web presence was their personal website.

# BORN OF LOGIC, RAISED BY SCIENCE

*The web was designed for scientists and academics.*

HTML and CSS, while not complex, require some technical understanding. Setting up a Web server a daunting task to the layperson. Networking might as well be black magic to most.

And so as the web grew and attracted more non-technical people, services evolved to simplify these tasks. Web hosting services like GeoCities and Angelfire made networking and hosting more accessible. Later, WordPress and other content management systems hid much of the code. Finally, platforms emerged. Their simple "You post, we host" model grew them a massive userbase.

# WALLED GARDEN RISING HIGH

*Death by megacorporation*

The ease of having someone else host, serve, and discover content has made platforms the primary method for engaging with the Web. It has gotten to a point that most users frequent 4 sites at most, if they even leave their apps. This dominance has come at a cost:

- *Attention Manipulation*: In order to retain your attention for longer and serve more ads, recommendation algorithms serve addictive content. Quality, truthfulness or usefulness are not considered if you're glued to the screen.
- *Data Collection*: Collecting any and all user data to serve you ever more hyper-targeted advertisements, even if that means tracking and invading your privacy, in what is essentially spying.
- *Censorship*: They delete, suppress and ban content that is deemed harmful to their advertising revenue, robbing you of potentially valuable perspectives.

This dependence on megacorporations gives them the power to dictate how your ideas reach the world.

# OWN YOUR WEB PRESENCE

*Fuck it, I'll just have to do it myself*

Not allowing the internet to slowly morph into a corporate playground and reviving the original spirit of the internet can help you gain:

- Freedom from censorship: No longer be at the mercy of platform algorithms and policies that can suppress content at will.
- Data sovereignty: Control who has access to your personal information and protect your privacy from unwanted eyes.
- Content ownership: Own your content outright, without fear of it being removed or altered by a third party.
- Technical and creative autonomy: Freely design and manage the functionality of your website and create something to your exact wants.
- A more resilient web: Contribute to a decentralized and diverse internet ecosystem, reducing centralization on a few dominant megacorporations.

# THE DO IT YOURSELF ETHOS

*Dream of a democratic web*

So if you're technically minded, overly curious, a tinkerer, or just very ideologically motivated: Come join in on the fun and create. I will not tell you what to do - you'll do your own thing, that's the entire point. I will offer you some ressources though:

## The IndieWeb

The [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) is a community project of independent personal websites based on the shared principles of owning your domain and using it as your primary online identity, publishing on your own site, and owning your content. 

## HUGO Static Site Generator

[HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) is a open-source static site generator. If you're using an existing theme, this is a very quick and efficient way of creating your own blog or website, and what I am using for this site.

## LandChad

[LandChad](https://landchad.net/) is a site dedicated to turning internet peasants into Internet Landlords by showing them how to setup websites, email servers, chat servers and everything in between. It contains documentation on setting up self-hosted services of many kinds.

## NeoCities

While I don't recommend depending on a platform like [NeoCities](https://neocities.org/), it offers many very beautiful, interesting and notable custom websites to use as inspiration in building your own.

## Hosting

Running your own Webserver from home is not always possible, so if you need to rent a small server somewhere, I have personally had great experiences with [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) and [Linode](https://www.linode.com/).

# Closing thoughts

I hope that I could motivate you to take part and build your own corner of the internet today. Happy hacking!
