# Create your own website!

 ![](hugo.png)

The modern web is a mess. What once was a decentralized, resilient network of individual servers was bastardized by big FAANG, centralized, robbed of character and filled with spyware and ads. Most users frequent 4 sites at most, if they're even leaving the dedicated apps on their phones. Nowdays, you post on a platform you depend on, and the platform tracks and spies on you to get better at selling you new shoes.

This makes everyone depend on the centralized services of the likes of Microsoft, Google, and more. The web was designed to be decentralized, for everyone to have their own corner to do their stuff, free from censorship and monopoly. People keep complaining about the censorship. YouTube demonitizes, Twitter (now X) shadow bans, TikTok demotes, Instagram locks your account. 

Here is the solution to this problem: Create your own website, away from censorship, free yourself of their grasp.
