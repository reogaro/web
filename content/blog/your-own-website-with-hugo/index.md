# Create your own website!

![](hugo.png)

## INTRO

The intro should explain the old internet. How it originally started off at CERN as a way to freely share research and information. Then, how in the 90s, people had their own pages and where free to post their stuff.

The decentralized internet for freely sharing research and knowledge is dead

The web was designed to be decentralized - Everyone should have their own website to do maintain, free from censorship and monopoly

## TWIST

Then, contrast this with the current system of privacy invading, censoring and centralized platforms run by megacorperations

But it was also designed for technical people, for scientists and academics. And so simply because they do the hosting and serving and content discovery conveniently in one place, people flock there on masse.

It was killed by megacorperations in the name of profit and power
that are manipulating you for attention, selling your information and expanding their ever growing influence across the globe
It has gotten to a point that most users frequent 4 sites at most, if they even leave their apps. Platforms promote and ban as they like. They sell your data. They disappear, taking all your content with them. You are dependent.

The allure of these platforms is undeniable â€“ they offer a centralized, user-friendly experience for hosting, sharing, and discovering content. However, this convenience comes at a cost. Your privacy, your freedom, your mind. If you're not paying for the product, you are the product. 

## RETURN

Then, highlight what we could gain from returning to the old system, or from incorperating more of it into our current internet

People keep complaining about the censorship. YouTube demonitizes, X shadow bans, TikTok algorithmically demotes, Instagram locks your account. You are dependent. The algorithm feeds you slop, instant gratification at the tap of a thumb, mindless autoplay to fall asleep. The signal is drowning in noise.

Here is the solution to this problem: Create your own website, away from censorship, free yourself of their grasp.
